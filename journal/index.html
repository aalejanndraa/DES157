          While looking through “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading & Visual Thinking Skills”
          from The New York Times Learning Network, I was reminded of what I call visual thinking — slowing down.
        </p>

        <p>
          The three open-ended questions of “What’s going on?”, “What do you see that makes you say that?”,
          and “What more can you find?” require evidence-based observations. As a designer, I recognize
          this is exactly how I critique my own work — not only reacting emotionally, but supporting
          my responses with visual evidence. This reinforces my belief that images require active reading;
          they provide meaning beyond what they initially appear to show.
        </p>

          For inspiration, I explored Mr. Panda’s Psychologically Safe Portfolio.
          The site uses soft illustrations, playful animation, and interactive storytelling to communicate
          personality and values. Its strongest quality is how visual and interactive elements reinforce
          the concept of psychological safety through rounded shapes, warm colors, and gentle movement.
          One drawback is that some animations slightly detract from readability.
          Overall, image and interaction are most effective when conceptually aligned rather than decorative.

          In Naema Baskanderi’s article, it points out how modal windows can be beneficial but are frequently overused.
          Modals are designed to call attention and help users stay on task; however, users have been conditioned
          to rapidly dismiss them since they interrupt workflow. The need for a clear “escape” option,
          such as a visible close button or the escape key, stood out to me. The discussion of accessibility
          and keyboard controls also emphasized how thoughtful interaction design improves usability.

          After reading Salim Ansari’s “Best Practices for Form Design,” I began to see how the thoughtful
          structure of a form affects completion rates. By reducing required information to only what is necessary,
          cognitive load decreases and users are more likely to finish the form.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using a single-column layout with labels above inputs creates a smoother flow and minimizes confusion.
          Clear error messages also help users correct mistakes without feeling blamed.
        </p>

        <p>
          A good example of a form that follows these best practices is the Apple account sign-up form,
          which uses clean structure and straightforward language.
