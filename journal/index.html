        <h3>Part One</h3>

          The images are about personal obsessions and intrusive thoughts. While they show ordinary objects,
          they become symbols of anxiety and accumulation. The most obvious aspect is the familiarity of the
          objects, while the most mysterious is the emotional weight attached to them. To push the concept
          further, stronger abstraction and dramatic lighting could make them feel more poetic and less documentary.

        <h3>Part Two</h3>

        <p>
          This picture of my friend and me reflected in a corner street mirror looks like a simple travel photo,
          but it represents something more personal. We had just run through the humid streets trying to find
          takoyaki before closing, only to discover the shop was not open. Instead of being frustrated, we turned
          it into another small adventure and got taiyaki instead. That moment reflects how I approach experiences —
          when plans fail, I see them as opportunities to explore.

          The convex mirror compresses and distorts space, placing us inside the environment rather than in front
          of it. My archive focuses on these in-between moments and how I move through unfamiliar spaces with
          curiosity and spontaneity. To make the image more compelling, I could crop tighter around the circular
          mirror and increase contrast to heighten distortion and atmosphere.
