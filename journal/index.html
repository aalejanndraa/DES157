        <h3>Part One</h3>

        <figure class="journal-figure">
          <img src="images/clothes.jpg" alt="image 1" />
          <img src="images/food.jpg" alt="image 2" />

          The images are about personal obsessions and intrusive thoughts. While they show ordinary objects,
          they become symbols of anxiety and accumulation, especially with the concept of placing them inside
          a large mouth. This transforms simple scenes into something psychological and unsettling. The most
          obvious aspect is the familiarity of the objects, while the most mysterious is the emotional weight
          attached to them. To push the narrative further, tighter cropping, stronger contrast, and more
          abstraction could make the images feel more poetic and less documentary.
        </p>

        <h3>Part Two</h3>

        <figure class="journal-figure single">

          This picture of myself and a friend taken in the corner street mirror looks like a nice vacation photograph, but it represents something much more personal to me. After spending time running around in the humid air trying to find takoyaki before the shop closed, we realised it was closed. Instead of being upset, we found another small adventure by having taiyaki instead. This moment describes how I view experiences — when plans go wrong, I view them as opportunities to explore and be spontaneous.

          The convex mirror creates a distortion of space and compresses distance so that we are included in the environment rather than in front of the environment; therefore, this reflection is symbolic of me inserting myself into the new place and not just observing this new place. My archive is about the way I explore unfamiliar spaces in a curious, impulsive manner and pursuing small adventures.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To push this image further, I could reduce the original image by cropping closely around the circular mirror in order to isolate the reflection and create more distortion. Increasing the contrast or darkening the edges of the image slightly would shift it from documentary to more introspective and atmospheric.

          While looking through “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading & Visual Thinking Skills”
          from The New York Times Learning Network, I was reminded of what I call visual thinking — slowing down.
        </p>

        <p>
          The three open-ended questions of “What’s going on?”, “What do you see that makes you say that?”,
          and “What more can you find?” require evidence-based observations. As a designer, I recognize
          this is exactly how I critique my own work — not only reacting emotionally, but supporting
          my responses with visual evidence. This reinforces my belief that images require active reading;
          they provide meaning beyond what they initially appear to show.
        </p>

          For inspiration, I explored Mr. Panda’s Psychologically Safe Portfolio.
          The site uses soft illustrations, playful animation, and interactive storytelling to communicate
          personality and values. Its strongest quality is how visual and interactive elements reinforce
          the concept of psychological safety through rounded shapes, warm colors, and gentle movement.
          One drawback is that some animations slightly detract from readability.
          Overall, image and interaction are most effective when conceptually aligned rather than decorative.

          In Naema Baskanderi’s article, it points out how modal windows can be beneficial but are frequently overused.
          Modals are designed to call attention and help users stay on task; however, users have been conditioned
          to rapidly dismiss them since they interrupt workflow. The need for a clear “escape” option,
          such as a visible close button or the escape key, stood out to me. The discussion of accessibility
          and keyboard controls also emphasized how thoughtful interaction design improves usability.

          After reading Salim Ansari’s “Best Practices for Form Design,” I began to see how the thoughtful
          structure of a form affects completion rates. By reducing required information to only what is necessary,
          cognitive load decreases and users are more likely to finish the form.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using a single-column layout with labels above inputs creates a smoother flow and minimizes confusion.
          Clear error messages also help users correct mistakes without feeling blamed.
        </p>

        <p>
          A good example of a form that follows these best practices is the Apple account sign-up form,
          which uses clean structure and straightforward language.
