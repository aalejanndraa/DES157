          After reading Salim Ansari’s “Best Practices for Form Design,” I began to see how the overall thoughtful structure
          of a form affects how completed it gets (specifically the number of input fields). By reducing the amount of
          information needed to only what is required, you reduce the cognitive load on the user and give them the feeling
          of finishing the form quickly. When there are fewer times that a user feels overwhelmed (from having an excessive
          number of inputs), the user will also have a better experience with the form. I have been frustrated in the past
          by forms that required excessive amounts of unnecessary information.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also found it interesting that one of the best practices for forms is to use a single column layout with the
          labels above the input field. This allows for a smooth flow through the form and minimizes confusion.
          Additionally, the section discussing error messages stood out to me. Providing concise and clear feedback helps
          users correct errors without placing blame on them.
        </p>

        <p>
          A good example of a form that follows these best practices is the Apple account sign-up form. It is clearly laid
          out, uses everyday language, and provides straightforward directions. This article helped me realize that good
          form design emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and user trust rather than aesthetics alone.

          Form example:
          <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Apple ID sign-up
          </a>
        </p>

        <p class="mini-note">
          The Apple sign-up form works well because it uses a clean single-column layout, clear labels, and only asks for
          necessary information. It was the first thing I thought of while reading about forms in the article.
