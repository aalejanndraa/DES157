          After reading Salim Ansari’s “Best Practices for Form Design,” I began to see how the overall
          thoughtful structure of a form affects how completed it gets. By reducing the amount of
          information needed to only what is required, you reduce the cognitive load on the user and
          make the form feel quicker to complete. When users feel less overwhelmed, they are more
          likely to finish the form.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also found it interesting that one of the best practices for forms is to use a single-column
          layout with labels above the input field. This creates a smoother flow and minimizes confusion.
          Clear error messages also stood out to me because they help users correct mistakes without
          feeling blamed.
        </p>

        <p>
          A good example of a form that follows these best practices is the Apple account sign-up form.
          It is clearly laid out, uses everyday language, and provides straightforward directions.

          Form example:
          <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/account"
             target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Apple ID sign-up
          </a>
        </p>

        <p class="mini-note">
          The Apple sign-up form works well because it uses a clean single-column layout,
          clear labels, and only asks for necessary information.

          In Naema Baskanderi’s article, it points out how modal windows can be beneficial but are frequently overused.
          Modals are designed to call attention and help users stay on task; however, users have been conditioned to
          rapidly dismiss them since they interrupt the work process. Another important point I took away from the
          article was the need for users to have a mechanism to “escape” from modal dialogs, such as a clearly defined
          close button or an escape key on their keyboard. The author also provided valuable insights into accessibility,
          including keyboard controls for managing focus within modals. Overall, the article made me think about how
          modals should be initiated by users and used purposefully rather than automatically.
