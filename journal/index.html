        While looking through “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading & Visual Thinking Skills”
        from The New York Times Learning Network, I was reminded of what I call visual thinking — slowing down.
      </p>

      <p>
        The three open-ended questions of “What’s going on?”, “What do you see that makes you say that?”,
        and “What more can you find?” were easy to understand, however they require evidence-based
        observations. As a designer, I recognize this is exactly how I critique my own work — not only
        responding emotionally, but supporting my responses with visual evidence. This reinforces my
        belief that images require active reading; they provide meaning beyond what they appear to show.
      </p>

        For inspiration, I explored Mr. Panda’s Psychologically Safe Portfolio. The website uses soft
        illustrations, playful animation, and interactive storytelling to communicate personality and
        values. Its strongest quality is how visual and interactive elements reinforce the concept of
        psychological safety through rounded shapes, warm colors, and gentle movement. One drawback
        is that some animations slightly detract from readability, which could overwhelm users.
        Overall, image and interaction are most effective when conceptually aligned rather than purely decorative.

        In Naema Baskanderi’s article, it points out how modal windows can be beneficial but are frequently overused.
        Modals are designed to call attention and help users stay on task; however, users have been conditioned to
        rapidly dismiss them since they interrupt the workflow. Another important point I took away from the
        article was the need for users to have a clear mechanism to “escape” from modal dialogs, such as a visible
        close button or the escape key. The author also provided valuable insights into accessibility, including
        keyboard controls for managing focus within modals. Overall, the article made me think about how
        modals should be initiated by users and used purposefully rather than automatically.

        After reading Salim Ansari’s “Best Practices for Form Design,” I began to see how the thoughtful
        structure of a form affects completion rates. By reducing the information required to only what is
        necessary, you reduce cognitive load and make the form feel quicker to complete. When users feel
        less overwhelmed, they are more likely to finish the form.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also found it interesting that one of the best practices for forms is using a single-column layout
        with labels above the input field. This creates a smoother flow and minimizes confusion. Clear
        error messages also stood out to me because they help users correct mistakes without feeling blamed.
      </p>

      <p>
        A good example of a form that follows these best practices is the Apple account sign-up form.
        It is clearly laid out, uses everyday language, and provides straightforward directions.

        Form example:
        <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/account"
           target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Apple ID sign-up
        </a>
      </p>

      <p class="mini-note">
        The Apple sign-up form works well because it uses a clean single-column layout,
        clear labels, and only asks for necessary information.
